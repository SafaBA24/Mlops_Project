This project aims to develop a binary classification model to identify messages as either "spam" or "non-spam" while applying MLOps best practices. Several algorithms were tested, and the best-performing model was selected: a RandomForest classifier combined with text preprocessing using TfidfVectorizer. The project steps include data preparation, model training, performance evaluation, and model logging with MLflow to facilitate management and deployment.
